Who founded National Labour Party?	"The National Labour Party is not a well-known political party. There have been several parties with this name in different countries, but none of them were founded by a single person of notable historical significance. Here are a few examples:

1. In Australia, the National Labour Party was a short-lived political party that existed from 1917 to 1922. It was formed as a result of a merger between the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Nationalist Party of Australia. The merger was not the result of the actions of a single founder but rather a response to political circumstances at the time.
2. In South Africa, the National Labour Party was a conservative political party that existed from 1953 to 1968. It was founded by a group of white businessmen and politicians who were dissatisfied with the policies of the National Party, which was then the ruling party in South Africa. The party advocated for a more moderate approach to racial issues and for the protection of the interests of white business. The party was not founded by a single person but rather by a group of influential individuals.
3. In the United Kingdom, there have been several political parties with the name National Labour Party, but none of them were founded by a single person of historical significance. One of the earliest was the National Labour Party (Britain), which was a short-lived political party that existed from 1932 to 1935. It was formed as a result of a merger between the Labour Party and the National Liberal Party. The merger was not the result of the actions of a single founder but rather a response to political circumstances at the time.

Therefore, there is no single person who founded the National Labour Party."	['John Bean']	1

The Family of the Vourdalak

The story revolves around a young man named Arkady, who is traveling with his friend, Sergei, to visit their mutual friend, Makar Ivanovich. They arrive at Makar's estate, where they find him in a state of despair. He tells them that his wife and daughter have been acting strangely, and he suspects that they are actually vampires, or ""Vourdalaks.""

Makar invites Arkady and Sergei to spend the night at his house, and they agree. That night, they hear strange noises coming from the women's quarters. They go to investigate and find that Makar's wife and daughter have indeed turned into Vourdalaks. They attack the men, but Arkady and Sergei manage to fend them off.

In the morning, they leave the estate and tell Makar that they will return with help. However, they never go back, as they are too afraid of the Vourdalaks. The story ends with Makar's lamentation about his lost family and his fear of the approaching dawn, when the Vourdalaks will come out to hunt for new victims.

Between the sense of loss and the intake of sense,
For we are without an American identity
And we are without an English or French
In the winter gardens of the retroactive senses
We shall be still and still moving
Into another intensity
For the sun rose early
For the sun rose early
Thoughts of the afternoon:
Of the lilies among the water
And the roses among the rushes;
Where is the summer, the concert?
Does the afternoon mean
What it always meant? Does the caroling
Engender good will; does the bird feel
The loss of autumn and the fall,
Beneath the lilac edge of the woods,
And the scarf-flower on the underwoods,
And all the birds that pause among the bushes
Feel autumn's loss that comes on the rivers
At their autumnal rise? Is there still no sound
On the autumn last, among the wasted leaves,
Among the hollow and rotten bulrush,
The still tabernacle with the dead priests,
The still water among the water-flags,
And the weeds growing in the damp and rotten leaves,
Under the wind's willow-herb in the autumn rain,
Is there hearable now the piercing down
Of lost words: ""Up, up, my lads, out of this nettle,
Down, down, my lads, under the earth,
Where the sun never shines, where snow piles up,
Where the moon never shines, where the wind never blows.
Hold your hand out, and feel how cold it is.
Nothing, nothing shall we be, but what we are,
Though season sleep on nothing can die.""

Winter is past,
The gated woods ar"	['George Winston']	1

They were married around 1532, and Nene bore Hideyoshi three children: Hideyori, Hidenobu, and Hidetsugu.

Who performed A Bus for a Bus on the Bus?	"""A Bus for a Bus"" is a performance art piece created by the American artist and activist Chris Burden. He first performed this work on October 17, 1975, in Los Angeles, California. In this piece, Burden rode a city bus with a full-sized replica of the bus's front end mounted on top of his car. The replica bus was connected to the real bus by a hinge, allowing it to fold down and touch the ground when the car went over bumps or when the bus stopped.

Burden drove the car with the replica bus on top to the bus stop, boarded the real bus, and paid his fare. He then sat on the bus with the replica bus still attached to his car outside. When the bus reached its destination, Burden disembarked, folded down the replica bus, and drove away.

So, Chris Burden performed ""A Bus for a Bus"" on a bus in 1975."	['Cardiacs']	1

Where did George Dorn die?	"George Dorn was an American football player who died on August 13, 1963. The circumstances surrounding his death are still a subject of debate and controversy. Some sources claim that he died during a practice session with the Dallas Texans (later known as the Kansas City Chiefs) in Dallas, Texas, while others suggest that he died in his hometown of Hibbing, Minnesota.

The most widely accepted account is that Dorn suffered a head injury during a scrimmage at the University of Texas at Austin on August 11, 1963, while playing with the Texans. He was taken to a hospital in Austin, but his condition worsened, and he was transported to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas for further treatment. He died three days later on August 13, 1963.

However, there is no definitive evidence to support this claim, and it is possible that La Mandr√°gora was a decentralized and informal network of anarchist activists rather than a formal organization with identified founders.

La Mandr√°gora is known for its role in the Mexican Revolution, particularly for its involvement in the Canutas uprising in 1911. The group advocated for the overthrow of the Mexican government and the establishment of a socialist society based on anarchist principles. They engaged in various forms of direct action, including sabotage, arson, and armed insurrection, against the Mexican authorities and their supporters.

Despite the lack of clear information about the founding of La Mandr√°gora, its influence on Mexican anarchist thought and activism is significant. The group's ideas and tactics continue to inspire anarchist and leftist movements in Mexico and beyond."	['Braulio Arenas']	1

Who founded De Beers?	"De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited, a multinational mining corporation and diamond empire, was not founded by a single individual. Instead, its origins can be traced back to several key events and individuals in the late 19th century.

The story began in 1866 when Erasmus Jacobs, a local farmer in Kimberley, South Africa, discovered the first diamond in the area. This discovery led to the Kimberley Diamond Rush, and by 1870, the diamond fields were being worked by thousands of miners.

In 1880, Cecil Rhodes, a British businessman and politician, formed the De Beers Mining Company to consolidate the various diamond mining claims in the region. Rhodes was a visionary entrepreneur who saw the potential in controlling the world's diamond supply. He believed that by owning the mines, he could control the price of diamonds and dominate the global diamond market.

In 1888, Rhodes merged his De Beers Mining Company with the Diamond Fields Consolidated Mines Limited, creating the De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited. Rhodes became the company's chairman, and he continued to expand its operations, acquiring more mines and establishing a monopoly on the world's diamond supply.

Rhodes' vision was realized, and De Beers became a powerful and influential corporation.

The German Social Union was officially formed on September 28, 1878, when the Conservative Party, the National Liberal Party, and several other smaller conservative and nationalist groups merged to form a unified political force. The merger was driven in part by the need to counter the growing influence of the Social Democratic Party and the liberal-leaning German Progress Party.

The first chairman of the German Social Union was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who played a key role in bringing about the merger. However, he stepped down as chairman in 1884 and was succeeded by various other leaders over the years.

So, to answer your question, no single person founded the German Social Union. Instead, it was the result of a merger of several existing political groups, with Chancellor Otto von Bismarck playing a key role in bringing about the merger."	['Otto Strasser']	1

Who founded Lw√≥w‚ÄìWarsaw school of logic?	"The Lw√≥w-Warsaw School of Logic was a group of mathematicians and logicians who worked in Poland between the two World Wars. The school was not founded by a single person, but rather emerged as a result of the work and influence of several key figures. Some of the most prominent members of the school include:

* Stanis≈Çaw Lesniewski (1886-1939): Lesniewski is considered one of the founders of the school, and is known for his work on set theory, logic, and semantics. He developed the system of Protothetic, which is a logical system for dealing with abstract objects.
* Jan ≈Åukasiewicz (1878-1956): ≈Åukasiewicz is another key figure in the Lw√≥w-Warsaw School of Logic. He is best known for his work on many-valued logic, which is a generalization of classical logic that allows for more than two truth values.
* Alfred Tarski (1901-1983): Tarski is another prominent member of the school, and is known for his work on formal semantics, set theory, and model theory. He developed the concept of a model in logic, which is a structure that makes the statements of a formal theory true or false.

These three mathematicians, along with others such as Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz and Adolf Lindenbaum, formed the core of the Lw√≥w-Warsaw School of Logic. They worked together in Lw√≥w (now Lviv, Ukraine) and later in Warsaw, and had a significant impact on the development of logic and mathematics in Poland and beyond."	['Kazimierz Twardowski']	1

Who was Assumption of the Virgin Mary created by?	"The doctrine of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which holds that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory at the end of her earthly life, is a dogma of the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

The belief in Mary's Assumption can be traced back to the early Christian era, with various early Christian writers expressing the belief that Mary was taken up into heaven. However, it was not until the Middle Ages that the doctrine began to be more explicitly articulated and defended by theologians. The most influential figure in the development of the doctrine of the Assumption was probably St. Bernard of Clairvaux, who wrote extensively on the subject in the 12th century.

The doctrine was formally defined as a dogma of the Catholic Church by Pope Pius XII in his apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus on November 1, 1950. The Eastern Orthodox Church also holds the doctrine of the Assumption, but it is not considered a dogma in the same way as in the Catholic Church. Instead, it is seen as a pious belief based on tradition and scripture."	['Peter Paul Rubens']	1

Who was The Goat Amalthea with the Infant Jupiter and a Faun created by?	"The myth of Amalthea and the infant Jupiter (also known as Zeus in Greek mythology) with a faun is rooted in ancient Greek mythology. The exact originator of this myth is not definitively known, as it has been passed down through oral tradition and various written sources. However, it is first recorded in the works of the ancient Greek poet Hesiod (around 8th century BC) and the poet Aratus (around 3rd century BC).

The story goes that Amalthea was a goat who raised Jupiter as an infant after he was hidden from his father, Saturn, to protect him from being devoured. Jupiter was suckled by Amalthea and grew up in her care. One day, when Jupiter had grown strong, he was discovered by his father. To protect Amalthea, Jupiter replaced the infant with a kid made of ivory and gold, which he had created with the help of the god Hephaestus and the faun Pan. Saturn raised the false infant, while Amalthea continued to care for Jupiter in secret.

So, the myth of Amalthea, the infant Jupiter, and the faun was likely created by the ancient Greek poets Hesiod and Aratus, or it may have evolved from earlier oral traditions."	['Gian Lorenzo Bernini']	1

Sophia is best known for her conversion to Catholicism, which caused a great deal of controversy and conflict in Ethiopia. She was sent to Europe to be raised as a Catholic and was later married to Prince Philip IV of Spain in 1648. The marriage was arranged as part of a treaty between Ethiopia and Spain, which recognized Spanish influence over Ethiopia in exchange for military and financial support.

Sophia's conversion and marriage caused a schism in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, which had been the dominant religious institution in Ethiopia for centuries. Many Ethiopians saw the Spanish influence as a threat to their culture and religious traditions, and there were several uprisings against Susenyos and his pro-Catholic policies.

Despite the controversy, Sophia is remembered as an important figure in Ethiopian history. She played a role in the spread of Christianity in Ethiopia and helped to establish diplomatic relations between Ethiopia and Europe. She also wrote several books, including a memoir of her life and a treatise on the Catholic faith.
