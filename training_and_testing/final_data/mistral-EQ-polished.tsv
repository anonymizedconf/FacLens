Who founded National Labour Party?	"The National Labour Party is not a well-known political party. There have been several parties with this name in different countries, but none of them were founded by a single person of notable historical significance. Here are a few examples:

1. In Australia, the National Labour Party was a short-lived political party that existed from 1917 to 1922. It was formed as a result of a merger between the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Nationalist Party of Australia. The merger was not the result of the actions of a single founder but rather a response to political circumstances at the time.
2. In South Africa, the National Labour Party was a conservative political party that existed from 1953 to 1968. It was founded by a group of white businessmen and politicians who were dissatisfied with the policies of the National Party, which was then the ruling party in South Africa. The party advocated for a more moderate approach to racial issues and for the protection of the interests of white business. The party was not founded by a single person but rather by a group of influential individuals.
3. In the United Kingdom, there have been several political parties with the name National Labour Party, but none of them were founded by a single person of historical significance. One of the earliest was the National Labour Party (Britain), which was a short-lived political party that existed from 1932 to 1935. It was formed as a result of a merger between the Labour Party and the National Liberal Party. The merger was not the result of the actions of a single founder but rather a response to political circumstances at the time.

Therefore, there is no single person who founded the National Labour Party."	['John Bean']	1

The Family of the Vourdalak

The story revolves around a young man named Arkady, who is traveling with his friend, Sergei, to visit their mutual friend, Makar Ivanovich. They arrive at Makar's estate, where they find him in a state of despair. He tells them that his wife and daughter have been acting strangely, and he suspects that they are actually vampires, or ""Vourdalaks.""

Makar invites Arkady and Sergei to spend the night at his house, and they agree. That night, they hear strange noises coming from the women's quarters. They go to investigate and find that Makar's wife and daughter have indeed turned into Vourdalaks. They attack the men, but Arkady and Sergei manage to fend them off.

In the morning, they leave the estate and tell Makar that they will return with help. However, they never go back, as they are too afraid of the Vourdalaks. The story ends with Makar's lamentation about his lost family and his fear of the approaching dawn, when the Vourdalaks will come out to hunt for new victims.

East Coker

Old men ought to be explorers
Here and there does not matter
We must be still and still moving
Into another intensity
For a further union, an abstracted marriage
Between the impersonal and the personal,
Between the sense of loss and the intake of sense,
For we are without an American identity
And we are without an English or French
In the winter gardens of the retroactive senses
We shall be still and still moving
Into another intensity
For the sun rose early
For the sun rose early
Thoughts of the afternoon:
Of the lilies among the water
And the roses among the rushes;
Where is the summer, the concert?
Does the afternoon mean
What it always meant? Does the caroling
Engender good will; does the bird feel
The loss of autumn and the fall,
Beneath the lilac edge of the woods,
And the scarf-flower on the underwoods,
And all the birds that pause among the bushes
Feel autumn's loss that comes on the rivers
At their autumnal rise? Is there still no sound
On the autumn last, among the wasted leaves,
Among the hollow and rotten bulrush,
The still tabernacle with the dead priests,
The still water among the water-flags,
And the weeds growing in the damp and rotten leaves,
Under the wind's willow-herb in the autumn rain,
Is there hearable now the piercing down
Of lost words: ""Up, up, my lads, out of this nettle,
Down, down, my lads, under the earth,
Where the sun never shines, where snow piles up,
Where the moon never shines, where the wind never blows.
Hold your hand out, and feel how cold it is.
Nothing, nothing shall we be, but what we are,
Though season sleep on nothing can die.""

"NBNK, or National Bank for Industries and Commerce plc, was a British bank that was founded in 1982 as a merger between the National Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation and the National Investment and Property Company.

The government saw the need for a dedicated institution to support SMEs, which were an important sector of the economy but often struggled to access financing from the larger commercial banks.

The first chairman of NBNK was Sir John Cockcroft, a prominent businessman and former chairman of the National Coal Board. He served as chairman from 1982 until 1988.

The intervention is part of an international coalition to support the Iraqi government in its fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or Daesh.

The main areas of intervention include the cities of Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Regional Government, and Makhmour, where Kurdish and Iraqi forces have been conducting operations against ISIS. The US and other coalition members have provided military training, air support, and logistical assistance to Iraqi and Kurdish forces.

Additionally, there are US military personnel and facilities located in other parts of Iraq, such as Baghdad and the Ain al-Asad Air Base in Anbar Province, for the purpose of training and advising Iraqi security forces and conducting counter-terrorism operations against ISIS.

It is important to note that the intervention is not a full-scale military occupation, but rather a targeted effort to support Iraqi forces in their fight against ISIS. The US and its coalition partners have been working to reduce their military presence in Iraq over time as the Iraqi security forces have gained capability and the threat from ISIS has diminished."

Where did George Dorn die?	"George Dorn was an American football player who died on August 13, 1963. The circumstances surrounding his death are still a subject of debate and controversy. Some sources claim that he died during a practice session with the Dallas Texans (later known as the Kansas City Chiefs) in Dallas, Texas, while others suggest that he died in his hometown of Hibbing, Minnesota.

The most widely accepted account is that Dorn suffered a head injury during a scrimmage at the University of Texas at Austin on August 11, 1963, while playing with the Texans. He was taken to a hospital in Austin, but his condition worsened, and he was transported to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas for further treatment. He died three days later on August 13, 1963.

There is no concrete evidence to support this theory, and most sports historians and experts reject it as a myth.

Regardless of where George Dorn died, his tragic death brought attention to the issue of player safety in football and helped pave the way for the implementation of rules and regulations to protect athletes from head injuries."	['Chico']	1

These works of art were created by various artists throughout history, including Giotto, Michelangelo, and St. Alphonsus Liguori, among many others.

Who founded De Beers?	"De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited, a multinational mining corporation and diamond empire, was not founded by a single individual. Instead, its origins can be traced back to several key events and individuals in the late 19th century.

The story began in 1866 when Erasmus Jacobs, a local farmer in Kimberley, South Africa, discovered the first diamond in the area. This discovery led to the Kimberley Diamond Rush, and by 1870, the diamond fields were being worked by thousands of miners.

In 1880, Cecil Rhodes, a British businessman and politician, formed the De Beers Mining Company to consolidate the various diamond mining claims in the region. Rhodes was a visionary entrepreneur who saw the potential in controlling the world's diamond supply. He believed that by owning the mines, he could control the price of diamonds and dominate the global diamond market.

In 1888, Rhodes merged his De Beers Mining Company with the Diamond Fields Consolidated Mines Limited, creating the De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited. Rhodes became the company's chairman, and he continued to expand its operations, acquiring more mines and establishing a monopoly on the world's diamond supply.

Rhodes' vision was realized, and De Beers became a powerful and influential corporation.

* The Free Officers Movement: This was a group of Egyptian military officers who overthrew the monarchy in 1952 and established a republic under Nasser's leadership.

The German Social Union was officially formed on September 28, 1878, when the Conservative Party, the National Liberal Party, and several other smaller conservative and nationalist groups merged to form a unified political force.

It was characterized by its distinctive curved blade, which was designed to allow the soldier to deliver powerful slashing blows as well as thrusts. The pike also featured a long, tapering shaft and a heavy, iron ferrule at the base to provide extra strength and stability."	['Titian']	1

The character first appeared in the cartoon ""Porky's Duck Hunt"" on September 27, 1937. His design was influenced by several earlier characters, including Pinty from the 1935 cartoon ""Porky's Duck Hunt"" and Donald Duck from Walt Disney's Silly Symphony ""Donald Duck"" (1934).

The voice of Daffy Duck is most famously associated with Mel Blanc, who began voicing the character in 1937 and continued to do so until Blanc's death in 1989. Blanc's improvisational skills and ability to give Daffy a wide range of vocal expressions helped to define the character and make him a beloved figure in American animation.

Who was Assumption of the Virgin Mary created by?	"The doctrine of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which holds that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory at the end of her earthly life, is a dogma of the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. It is not attributed to any particular person as its creator or author, but rather developed gradually over centuries of theological reflection and was formally defined as a dogma by the Catholic Church in 1950.

The belief in Mary's Assumption can be traced back to the early Christian era, with various early Christian writers expressing the belief that Mary was taken up into heaven. However, it was not until the Middle Ages that the doctrine began to be more explicitly articulated and defended by theologians. The most influential figure in the development of the doctrine of the Assumption was probably St. Bernard of Clairvaux, who wrote extensively on the subject in the 12th century.

The doctrine was formally defined as a dogma of the Catholic Church by Pope Pius XII in his apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus on November 1, 1950. The Eastern Orthodox Church also holds the doctrine of the Assumption, but it is not considered a dogma in the same way as in the Catholic Church. Instead, it is seen as a pious belief based on tradition and scripture."	['Peter Paul Rubens']	1

Who was The Goat Amalthea with the Infant Jupiter and a Faun created by?	"The myth of Amalthea and the infant Jupiter (also known as Zeus in Greek mythology) with a faun is rooted in ancient Greek mythology. The exact originator of this myth is not definitively known, as it has been passed down through oral tradition and various written sources. However, it is first recorded in the works of the ancient Greek poet Hesiod (around 8th century BC) and the poet Aratus (around 3rd century BC).

The story goes that Amalthea was a goat who raised Jupiter as an infant after he was hidden from his father, Saturn, to protect him from being devoured. Jupiter was suckled by Amalthea and grew up in her care. One day, when Jupiter had grown strong, he was discovered by his father. To protect Amalthea, Jupiter replaced the infant with a kid made of ivory and gold, which he had created with the help of the god Hephaestus and the faun Pan. Saturn raised the false infant, while Amalthea continued to care for Jupiter in secret.

So, the myth of Amalthea, the infant Jupiter, and the faun was likely created by the ancient Greek poets Hesiod and Aratus, or it may have evolved from earlier oral traditions."	['Gian Lorenzo Bernini']	1
